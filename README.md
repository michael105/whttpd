### whttpd

#### ''SSA'' micro webserver


For local website development, instantly usable without configuration.

Forking, using sendfile. ('new' linux syscall).


Uses inotify and ''SSA'' (Server Side Aborts) to watch the webroot and instantly reload all html pages in the browser,
when files within the web directory hierarchy are changed. 
Reload also 404 sites and directory indexes with new content.

Can optionally automatically rebuild pages with make or any other tool, 
if sources are changed in the htmlroot or any other watched location.

Optionally build html pages from markdown files with lowdown or any other tool on the fly.

To trigger reloads a small (10 lines) javascript is appended to each page,
which shouldn't interfere with other javascript frameworks. (using fetch)

-----

##### Install:

Either build yourself, or download the binary for 64bit linux supplied in
/bin. The binary is statically linked with musl.

Configuration is done via commandline arguments.

To browse markdown files as html, lowdown is needed.

##### Usage:


   `whttpd`

serve the current directory at port 4000.
(http://localhost:4000)


`whttpd -w [htmlroot]`

Start webserver (default port 4000) and the 'ssa' server (port 4001).  
Modify all sent html pages, append a small javascript, and trigger reloads  
in the clients, as soon files within htmlroot are modified, added or
deleted.
